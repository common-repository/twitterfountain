2. It adds a configurable Twitterfountain 'widget', to use in your Wordpress theme's sidebar (provided the theme you are using supports widgets).

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the extracted 'twitterfountain' folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
3. Activate the plugin.
